        <p>Agriculture is the source of food, feed, and fibre that feeds us, puts clothes on our backs, provides lumber for our houses, and organic things that grow in the soil or some substitute for it. Animal husbandry is also part of the process that grows the meat, milk, and eggs we eat and the wool we wear. There is a lot of importance of agriculture in the national economy. Agriculture is very important to any nation simply because it does several things. Firstly, it acts as a foreign exchange for a country. The exports of agricultural products achieve this. Another role of agriculture is to act as a ready market to the industries. This is done when the pieces of equipment are purchased from the industries hence contributing to the development of such a nation. The main objective of agriculture is to produce food for the country’s members, Though several things affect the agricultural sector. </p>

            <p>1. Bee Vectoring Technologies
              1-bee
              
              When it comes to U.S. crop production, honey bees are worth $20 billion. These insects are essential to human survival, so there is increasing innovation in agriculture equipment to help protect bees and maximize their pollination capabilities.
              
              BVT uses commercially reared bees to deliver targeted crop controls through pollination, replacing chemical pesticides with an environmentally safe crop protection system.
              
              The system doesn’t require spraying water or the use of tractors. Instead, the scientifically designed bumblebee hive allows bees to pick up a trace amount of pest control powders on their legs to spread as they travel within the field.
              
              This innovation in agriculture technology supports improved sustainable farming, crop yield, and soil quality. BVT’s solution is suitable for many crops, including blueberries, sunflowers, apples, and tomatoes, and it also works for farms of all sizes.<br>
              
              2. Precision Agriculture
              Precision agriculture is an agricultural resource management strategy that collects, processes, and evaluates data and offers insights to help farmers optimize and increase soil quality and productivity.
              
              Management decisions count on precision agriculture data points to improve farmland and farm produce across several key areas, including:
              
              Resource use efficiency
              Sustainability
              Profitability
              Productivity
              Quality
              This innovation in agriculture technology uses big data to aid management decisions, enabling farmers to control crop yield variables like moisture level, soil condition, and microclimates to maximize output. It relies on remote sensing systems, drones, robotics, and automation to improve crop health and optimize agricultural resources, leading to more productivity.
              
              Grand View Research projects that the global precision farming market will hit $16.35 billion by 2028, growing at a 13.1% CAGR. The organization believes increasing government support and the growing need for efficient crop health monitoring will drive market growth.
              <br>
              3. Indoor Vertical Farming
              The average yield of rice per hectare is between three and six tonnes. However, farmers don’t have to face this limitation when using indoor vertical farming. This Indoor vertical farming grows farm produce stacked above another in a closed and controlled environment. The technology uses growing shelves mounted vertically to increase crop yield in limited spaces. Quite often, the shelves don’t require soil—they’re either hydroponic or aeroponic:
              
              Hydroponics is a gardening practice that grows plants in water and nutrient solutions.
              Aeroponics suspends the roots of the crops in the air, with emitters intermittently spraying them with water and nutrients.
              Indoor vertical farms enable growers to control variables such as light, temperature, water, and sometimes, carbon dioxide levels, allowing them to get healthier and bigger yields.
              
              Other benefits of the technology include 70% less water usage, which conserves energy, and reduced labor costs due to the use of robots for harvesting and planting.

            <p>Crop prices refer to the value assigned to agricultural products, such as crops, livestock, and livestock products, at various levels including wholesale markets, shipping points, and terminal markets 1. The prices of these products are influenced by factors like weather hazards and global economic conditions, leading to a broad scatter of prices 8.

              In India, the government intervenes in the market to ensure that farmers receive a fair price for their produce through the Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism</p>
